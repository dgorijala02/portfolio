                                <p>Developed a Personalized Game Recommender System using machine learning to predict global video game sales based on the dataset. The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection (such as regional sales and critic scores), and the application of various machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models achieved high accuracy (96%-97%), while Random Forest and Ridge Regression demonstrated strong performance with minimal error. The analysis highlighted North American sales and critic scores as the most important predictors for global sales. This project showcases my ability to leverage machine learning techniques to generate insights and make accurate predictions in the video game industry.</p>

                                <p>Developed an image captioning model using the Flickr8k dataset by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for generating descriptive text. The project involved comprehensive preprocessing of both image and text data. Image preprocessing was carried out using CNNs to extract meaningful features, while text preprocessing included techniques like tokenization and padding to prepare the captions for input into the RNN. To optimize training, I employed techniques such as early stopping, checkpointing, and learning rate reduction, which helped in improving model performance and preventing overfitting over the course of 50 epochs. Additionally, beam search was implemented to generate more accurate and coherent captions. The model demonstrated its ability to generate descriptive and contextually relevant captions for unseen images.</p>

Key features include task management functionalities such as adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as complete, with persistent storage achieved through AsyncStorage to retain tasks across sessions. The app utilizes the Animated API to implement fade-in/out and scale effects, enhancing the user experience. The design is minimalistic and intuitive, with a floating action button for easy task management and inline task editing with auto-focus. The app was tested on an iPhone simulator via Xcode and deployed to a physical device using Expo.</p>
